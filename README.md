# Safe Key: Secure File Protection Software
Safe Key is a powerful software solution designed to keep files secure by utilizing a USB device as a key. With Safe Key, you can ensure the confidentiality and integrity of your sensitive data through encryption and secure storage. This software provides an extra layer of protection for users who require enhanced security measures.

### File Encryption and Hiding üîê
Safe Key employs advanced encryption algorithms to encrypt and hide files when the USB device is not inserted. This means that without the USB key, the files are inaccessible and remain hidden from prying eyes. By encrypting the files, even if they are somehow accessed, they cannot be deciphered without the correct key.

### USB Key Activation üóùÔ∏è
Once the USB device with the correct key is inserted into the computer, Safe Key automatically decrypts and reveals the hidden files. The decrypted files become visible and accessible to authorized users, allowing them to work with the files seamlessly. This activation process provides convenient access to your protected files while maintaining their security.

### Key Recovery ü§ï
In the unfortunate event of losing the USB key, there is no need to panic. Safe Key has a built-in solution for key recovery. The secret key associated with the USB device is securely stored in the Pangea vault. Users can retrieve the key from the vault and transfer it to a new USB device using the Safe Key software. This ensures that users can regain access to their encrypted files without compromising their security.

### Enhanced Security üõü
Safe Key prioritizes the security of your files and employs robust measures to safeguard your data. By using encryption algorithms and hiding files when the USB key is not present, it ensures that unauthorized individuals cannot access your sensitive information. Additionally, the Pangea vault securely stores the secret key, reducing the risk of key loss or unauthorized retrieval.
